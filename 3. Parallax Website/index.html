        <h2>F15s</h2>
        <p>The F-15 has a wingspan of 42 feet 9.75 inches (13.05 m) and a length of 63 feet 9 inches (19.43 m). It is powered by two Pratt & Whitney or General Electric turbofan engines, which with afterburning can generate from 23,000 to 29,000 pounds of thrust, accelerating the aircraft to more than twice the speed of sound. The single-seat air-superiority version is armed with a 20-millimetre rotary cannon and an array of short-range and medium-range air-to-air missiles. In the fighter-bomber version, known as the Strike Eagle, a weapons officer seated behind the pilot controls the delivery of a number of guided missiles and bombs. 
            The USAF had planned to replace all of its air superiority F-15s with the F-22 Raptor by the 2010s, but the severely reduced F-22 procurement forced the service to operate some F-15C/Ds until 2026 and replace them with newly built F-15EX Eagle II in order to retain an adequate number of air superiority fighters. The F-15E Strike Eagle is expected to continue operating in the USAF into the 2030s. The F-15 is in service with numerous countries, with production of enhanced variants ongoing.

        <h2>Gripen</h2>
        <p>The Saab JAS 39 Gripen is a light single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by the Swedish aerospace and defence company Saab AB. The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire flight controls. Later aircraft are fully NATO interoperable. As of 2020, more than 271 Gripens of all models, Aâ€“F, have been delivered.In 1979, the Swedish government began development studies for "an aircraft for fighter, attack, and reconnaissance" (ett jakt-, attack- och spaningsflygplan, hence "JAS") to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force. A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39. The first flight took place in 1988, with delivery of the first serial production airplane in 1993.[1] It entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1996.[1] Upgraded variants, featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times, began entering service in 2003.

        <h2>Mirage Art</h2>
        <p>Group Captain Syed Masood Akhtar Hussaini is the official Military Aviation Artist of the Pakistan Air Force. Born in January 1951, he joined PAF College, Sargodha in 1963 and was commissioned as a pilot in March 1971 at the PAF Academy, Risalpur, gaining a Bachelor's degree from that institution. In 1973 he qualified as an Air Defence Weapons Controller, a capacity in which he continued to serve until his retirement in 2000. In addition to five full-colour volumes of his paintings, Hussaini's art work has appeared in several other publications. On the 40th anniversary of the PAF, the Government of Pakistan issued ten commemorative postage stamps, all bearing the miniaturised prints of his aviation paintings. Several exhibitions of his art have been held.Hussaini is well-known in foreign countries. His paintings are displayed in the air force premises of Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, the UK, the USA and Zimbabwe. In 1987, the President of Pakistan conferred on him the Tamgha-i-Basalat (medal of honour) in recognition of his contributions as the Aviation Artist of the PAF. This was followed in 1998 by the President's Gold Medal for Pride of Performance to Hussaini. Keith Ferris (Founder ASAA) was the first professional artist to recognise Hussaini's extraordinary talent and became his friend and mentor, sharing with him the outstanding ability for using the aerial points of view that are both unusual and dramatic, perspectives that impart a sense of speed and excitement on the scene. Ferris also visited Hussaini's studios at King Khalid Air Base in Saudi Arabia in 1981 and at Chaklala Air Base in Pakistan in 1987. Although retired from active air force duty, Hussaini's commitment to art and the PAF continues with undiminished vigour.
